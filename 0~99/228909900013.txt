AB Motivation: The study of sequence space, and the deciphering of the
   structure of protein families and subfamilies, has up to now been
   required for work in comparative genomics and for the prediction of
   protein function. With the emergence of structural proteomics projects,
   it is becoming increasingly important to be able to select protein
   targets for structural studies that will appropriately cover the space
   of protein sequences, functions and genomic distribution.
   These problems are the motivation for the development of methods for
   clustering protein sequences and building families of potentially
   orthologous sequences, such as those proposed here.
   Results: First we developed a clustering strategy (Ncut algorithm)
   capable of forming groups of related sequences by assessing their
   pairwise relationships. The results presented for the ras super-family
   of proteins are similar to those produced by other clustering methods,
   but without the need for clustering the full sequence space. The Ncut
   clusters are then used as the input to a process of reconstruction of
   groups with equilibrated genomic composition formed by closely-related
   sequences. The results of applying this technique to the data set used
   in the construction of the COG database are very similar to those
   derived by the human experts responsible for this database.

AB Clustering problems are well-known in the database literature for their
   use in numerous applications, such as customer segmentation,
   classification, and trend analysis. High-dimensional data has always
   been a challenge for clustering algorithms because of the inherent
   sparsity of the points. Recent research results indicate that, in
   high-dimensional data, even the concept of proximity or clustering may
   not be meaningful. We introduce a very general concept of projected
   clustering which is able to construct clusters in arbitrarily aligned
   subspaces of lower dimensionality. The subspaces are specific to the
   clusters themselves. This definition is substantially more general and
   realistic than the currently available techniques which limit the method
   to only projections from the original set of attributes. The generalized
   projected clustering technique may also be viewed as a way of trying to
   redefine clustering for high-dimensional applications by searching for
   hidden subspaces with clusters which are created by interattribute
   correlations. We provide a new concept of using extended cluster feature
   vectors in order to make the algorithm scalable for very large
   databases. The running time and space requirements of the algorithm are
   adjustable and are likely to trade-off with better accuracy.

AB Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype of
   non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40% of patients
   respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas the
   remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability in
   natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the
   tumours, Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic
   characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show
   that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL
   patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation
   rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We
   identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene
   expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell
   differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal
   centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type
   expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of
   peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'), Patients with
   germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival
   than those with activated B-like DLBCL, The molecular classification of
   tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously
   undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.

AB Oligonucleotide arrays can provide a broad picture of the state of the
   cell, by monitoring the expression level of thousands of genes at the
   same time. It is of interest to develop techniques for extracting useful
   information from the resulting data sets. Here we report the application
   of a two-way clustering method for analyzing a data set consisting of
   the expression patterns of different cell types. Gene expression in 40
   tumor and 22 normal colon tissue samples was analyzed with an Affymetrix
   oligonucleotide array complementary to more than 6,500 human genes. An
   efficient two way clustering algorithm was applied to both the genes and
   the tissues, revealing broad coherent patterns that suggest a high
   degree of organization underlying gene expression in these tissues.
   Coregulated families of genes clustered together, as demonstrated for
   the ribosomal proteins. Clustering also separated cancerous from
   noncancerous tissue and cell lines from in vivo tissues on the basis of
   subtle distributed patterns of genes even when expression of individual
   genes varied only slightly between the tissues, Two-way clustering thus
   may be of use both in classifying genes into functional groups and in
   classifying tissues based on gene expression.

AB In this paper we consider the problem of clustering m objects into c
   clusters. The objects are represented by points in an n-dimensional
   Euclidean space, and the objective is to classify these m points into c
   clusters such that the distance between points within a cluster and its
   center (which is to be found) is minimized. The problem is a nonconvex
   program that has many local minima. It has been studied by many
   researchers and the most well-known algorithm for solving it is the
   k-means algorithm. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for solving
   this problem based on a tabu search technique. Preliminary computational
   experience on the developed algorithm are encouraging and compare
   favorably with both the k-means and the simulated annealing algorithms.

AB The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA
   databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety
   of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here
   permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased
   substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities, A
   new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a
   new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST
   program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the
   original, In addition, a method is introduced for automatically
   combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a
   position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this
   matrix, The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST)
   program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped
   BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically
   relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new
   and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.

AB The applicability of evolution strategies (ESs), population based
   stochastic optimization techniques, to optimize clustering objective
   functions is explored. Clustering objective functions are categorized
   into centroid and non-centroid type of functions. Optimization of the
   centroid type of objective functions is accomplished by formulating them
   as functions of real-valued parameters using ESs. Both hard and fuzzy
   clustering objective functions are considered in this study.
   Applicability of ESs to discrete optimization problems is extended to
   optimize the non-centroid type of objective functions. As ESs are
   amenable to parallelization, a parallel model (master/slave model) is
   described in the context of the clustering problem. Results obtained for
   selected data sets substantiate the utility of ESs in clustering.

AB Motivation: DNA microarrays are now capable of providing genome-wide
   patterns of gene expression across many different conditions. The first
   level of analysis of these patterns requires determining whether
   observed differences in expression are significant or not. Current
   methods are unsatisfactory due to the lack of a systematic framework
   that can accommodate noise, variability, and low replication often
   typical of microarray data.
   Results: We develop a Bayesian probabilistic framework for microarray
   data analysis. At the simplest level, we model log-expression values by
   independent normal distributions, parameterized by corresponding means
   and variances with hierarchical prior distributions. We derive point
   estimates for both parameters and hyperparameters, and regularized
   expressions for the variance of each gene by combining the empirical
   variance with a local background variance associated with neighboring
   genes. An additional hyperparameter, inversely related to the number of
   empirical observations, determines the strength of the background
   variance. Simulations show that these point estimates, combined with a
   t-test, provide a systematic inference approach that compares favorably
   with simple t-test or fold methods, and partly compensate for the lack
   of replication.

AB Part I of this paper proposes a definition of the adaptive resonance

   clustering networks. Class ART generalizes several well-known clustering
   models, e.g., ART 1, improved ART 1, adaptive Hamming net (AHN), and
   Fuzzy ART, which are optimized in terms of memory storage and/or
   computation time. Next, the symmetric Fuzzy ART (S-Fuzzy ART) network is
   presented as a possible improvement over Fuzzy ART. As a generalization
   of S-Fuzzy ART, the simplified adaptive resonance theory (SART) group of
   ART algorithms is defined. Gaussian ART (GART), which is found in the
   literature, is presented as one more instance of class SART. In Part 11
   of this work, a novel SART network, called fully self-organizing SART
   (FOSART), is proposed and compared with Fuzzy ART, S-Fuzzy ART, GART and
   other well-known clustering algorithms. Results of our comparison may
   easily extend to the ARTMAP supervised learning framework.

AB Clustering algorithms aim at modeling fuzzy (i.e., ambiguous) unlabeled
   patterns efficiently. Our goal is to propose a theoretical framework
   where the expressive power of clustering systems can be compared on the
   basis of a meaningful set of common functional features. Part I of this
   paper reviews the following issues related to clustering approaches
   found in the literature: relative (probabilistic) and absolute
   (possibilistic) fuzzy membership functions and their relationships to
   the Bayes rule, batch and on-line learning, prototype editing schemes,
   growing and pruning networks, modular network architectures,
   topologically perfect mapping, ecological nets and neuro-fuzziness. From
   this discussion an equivalence between the concepts of fuzzy clustering
   and soft competitive learning in clustering algorithms is proposed as a
   unifying framework in the comparison of clustering systems. Moreover, a
   set of functional attributes is selected for use as dictionary entries
   in the comparison of clustering algorithms, which is the subject of Part
   II of this paper [1].

AB Recent advances in biotechnology allow researchers to measure expression
   levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, across different
   conditions and over time. Analysis of data produced by such experiments
   offers potential insight into gene function and regulatory mechanisms. A
   key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the detection of
   groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns. The
   corresponding algorithmic problem is to cluster multicondition gene
   expression patterns, In this paper we describe a novel clustering
   algorithm that was developed for analysis of gene expression data. We
   define an appropriate stochastic error model on the input, and prove
   that under the conditions of the model, the algorithm recovers the
   duster structure with high probability, The running time of the
   algorithm on an n-gene dataset is O{n(2)[log(n)](c)}. We also present a
   practical heuristic based on the same algorithmic ideas. The heuristic
   was implemented and its performance is demonstrated on simulated data
   and on real gene expression data, with very promising results.

AB We present a novel clustering method using the approach of support
   vector machines. Data points are mapped by means of a Gaussian kernel to
   a high dimensional feature space, where we search for the minimal
   enclosing sphere. This sphere, when mapped back to data space, can
   separate into several components, each enclosing a separate cluster of
   points. We present a simple algorithm for identifying these clusters.
   The width of the Gaussian kernel controls the scale at which the data is
   probed while the soft margin constant helps coping with outliers and
   overlapping clusters. The structure of a dataset is explored by varying
   the two parameters, maintaining a minimal number of support vectors to
   assure smooth cluster boundaries. We demonstrate the performance of our
   algorithm on several datasets.
